// CHECK TRIANGLE
// Determine if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.
// An equilateral triangle has all three sides the same length.
// An isosceles triangle has at least two sides the same length.
// A scalene triangle has all sides of different lengths.
// Note: For a shape to be a triangle at all, all sides have to be of length > 0, and the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the third side. See Triangle Inequality.
// Dig Deeper: The case where the sum of the lengths of two sides equals that of the third is known as a degenerate triangle - it has zero area and looks like a single line.
